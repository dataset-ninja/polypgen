**PolypGen** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 8037 images with 3734 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class different classes (*polyp*).

Images in the PolypGen dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 4916 (61% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 cases: ***negative*** (4275 images) and ***positive*** (3762 images). Also ***institute*** and ***sequence*** tags are included.. The dataset was released in 2022 by the University of Leeds,  University of Oxford, Oxford National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research centre, SimulaMet,  UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Arab Academy for Science and Technology, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, , Sahlgrenska University Hospital-Molnda, CRO Centro Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS Aviano Italy, 1Universite de Versailles St-Quentin en Yvelines, University of Alexandria, Universite de Lorraine and CNRS, University of Gothenburg, Augere Medical, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo University Hospital Ulleval, and Northwestern University.
